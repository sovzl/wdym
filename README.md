### Instructions:

1. **Using `>` - the Child Combinator:**
   - Style the paragraphs directly inside the `.content-wrapper` with a different background color.
   - Style the first `.sidebar-item` with a border and a padding of 10 pixels.

2. **Using `+` - the Adjacent Sibling Combinator:**
   - Style the first paragraph directly following the `.nested-div` with increased font size and bold text.
   - Style the second paragraph directly following the `.inner-div` with italic text.

3. **Using `~` - the General Sibling Combinator:**
   - Style paragraphs following `.nested-div` with a different font color.
   - Style paragraphs following `.inner-div` with a different background color.

Feel free to experiment with additional CSS properties and values to enhance the styles further. Remember, you are limited to using only `>`, `+`, and `~` combinators to target specific elements within the nested structure.
